# [Portfolio](https://justinbear99.github.io/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), styled with [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and deployed with [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For beginers, I recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8) to help you hand on quickly.

## Notes
1. if you want your portfolio page be at `your-name.github.io`, you should name your repository as `your-name.github.io` and modify `homepage` in `package.json`. Otherwise, the page will be deploy at `your-name.github.io/repo-name`.
2. Since gh-pages do not support client side routing, there are two solution described [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing). I chose the second one btw.
